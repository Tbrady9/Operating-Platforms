**Overview:** The Gaming Room has a software requirement for a web-based gaming app known as Draw it or Lose it. The app will be a game involving multiple players and teams that will access a large library of pictures. Teams will compete in guessing what picture is being drawn.

**What was done well?:** Overall documentation was done well. All thoughts were clearly organized and relayed in a well thought out manner.

**What about the process was helpful for development?:** All of it. The organization of the document makes it easy to perform a checklist to make sure all research is done and all recommendations are clearly recorded. The UML makes it much easier to lay out all of the logic and develop more cleanly.

**What part of your work would you change?:** As pointed out by Professor Lanham, recommendations are clearly recorded but a little more supporting detail would help. For this, I plan to do more research and edit the document.

**How did you interpret the user's needs? Why is this important?:** The user was clear in relaying their request. A web-based app was needed. Performance and flexibility were key. We needed to make sure we developed with the knowledge that future expansion of things like audience and the picture library were intended. Getting the user's request correct is extremely important. If their needs aren't met, they could use a different developer or require changes that would take more time and resource.

**How did you approach development?:** The software design document is extremely useful. Blindly jumping in and starting development often results in wasted work. Having a place to store all of your thoughts is helpful to make sure all needs are met before development. The UML is a great tool to serve as a blueprint for development and show how each class will fit within the project. I will be using these tools again in the future.
